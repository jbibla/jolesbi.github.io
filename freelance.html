  <p>So, you're interested in working together on a web project. That's great news. I love new projects and am currently available to spend some time on yours.</p>
  <p>I love designing intelligent user experiences, making meaningful connections, and working with clients to build great websites.</p>
  <p>Before we collaborate on your project I need to learn a few things about your objectives. Please take a few minutes to fill out the form below.</p>
  <a href="">
    <div class="post">
      <span class="form-link">Reach out! Here is the form! Click here!</span>
    </div>
  </a>
  <p>I hope you'll reach out so we can discuss your project together. Communication is essential for the success of a collaborative project.</p>

  <span class="content-divider"></span>
  <p>Here are some of the services I can provide.</p>

  <div class="post">
    <ul>
      <li>user experience design</li>
      <li>front end web development</li>
      <li>user interface design</li>
      <li>graphic design + photo editing</li>
      <li>content strategy</li>
      <li>copywriting</li>
      <li>custom Squarespace deployments</li>
      <li>ongoing maintenance + content updates</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>My rate for the above is $60.00 an hour. The minimum for a web project is $1600. Once I have a thorough understanding of the project requirements I will make an estimate as to how long theproject will take.</p>
  <p>At this point, I will send an invoice with an estimate and a detailed statement of work. Once&nbsp;we agree on a timeline, I will ask for a 50%&nbsp;deposit before we begin working on your project.</p>
  <p>Feel free to reach out with any questions or ideas. I'd love to chat.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Thank you kindly,<br><br>â€”Jordan</p>
